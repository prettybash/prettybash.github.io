# 🪧 PrettyBash Overview

Tired of plain, monochrome, and monotonous Bash scripts? This collection is your ultimate library to transform your
terminal applications into visually engaging, user-friendly, and professionally polished experiences. It goes beyond
mere functionality to focus on the command line user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).

<br>
<br>

# 🎯 Key Benefits of Using This Library

- Improved User Experience (UX): Users can instantly understand the script's status, identify errors, and navigate
  options with ease.

- Professional Polish: A well-formatted script reflects a higher level of care and quality, making your work stand out.

- Reduced User Error: Clear visual cues and interactive menus prevent mistakes and misinterpretations.

- Enhanced Debugging: Color-coding output (e.g., errors in red, debug info in cyan) makes it faster to identify and fix
  issues during development.
